Kopyala
Düzenle
# Initialize a new Git repository  
git init  

# Clone a repository from GitHub  
git clone <repo_url>  

# Stage changes for commit  
git add <file>  

# Save staged changes with a message  
git commit -m "message"  

# Push commits to the remote repository  
git push origin main  

# Fetch the latest updates from the remote repository  
git pull origin main  

# Create a new branch  
git branch <branch_name>  

# Switch to another branch  
git checkout <branch_name>  

# Merge a branch into the current one  
git merge <branch_name>  
🔄 Local vs. GitHub Workflow
🏠 Local Git Workflow:
Modifications were made directly on my local system.
Changes were staged with git add.
Commits were recorded using git commit.
The repository remained offline until pushed to GitHub.
☁️ GitHub Workflow:
Updates were pushed to GitHub using git push.
Collaboration was facilitated through pull requests and code reviews.
Merges were conducted either via GitHub UI or using git merge.
The latest updates were retrieved using git pull.
⚠️ Challenges Encountered
Differentiating between local and remote repositories.
Handling merge conflicts when working across multiple branches.
Ensuring the correct sequence of Git commands to prevent errors.
Managing the staging process effectively.
✅ Commit Strategy: When I Chose to Commit
I committed changes at critical moments, such as:

After implementing a new feature or resolving a bug.
Before pulling updates from the remote repository.
Post-merge conflict resolution to maintain a stable state.
Prior to switching branches to avoid potential data loss.
